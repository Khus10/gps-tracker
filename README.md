# gps-tracker
This project is an IoT system that retrieves real-time GPS coordinates from a user's laptop, processes them, and transmits them to a cloud database (Firebase Realtime Database). The data is then visualized on a web dashboard with a live map. The system also triggers an alert if the user moves more than 500 meters from their starting point.
